There are several ways to validate a JWT token, depending on your specific requirements and the tools or libraries you are using. Here are some common methods:

Signature Verification: This is the most common and crucial step in JWT validation. The token's signature is verified using a secret key or a public key. The verification process ensures that the token has not been tampered with and that it was issued by a trusted party.

Expiration Check: JWT tokens usually have an expiration time (exp claim) to enforce their validity for a specific period. Before accepting and processing a token, you should check if it has expired. If the token's expiration time has passed, it should be considered invalid.

Issuer Check: The issuer (iss claim) indicates the entity that issued the token. During validation, you can check if the issuer matches the expected value. This helps ensure that the token is issued by a trusted authority.

Audience Check: The audience (aud claim) specifies the intended recipient of the token. You can validate that the audience matches the expected value for your API or application. This helps prevent tokens issued for one audience from being used for another.

Claims Validation: You can perform additional validation on the claims within the token to ensure that they meet your requirements. For example, you might check for specific roles or permissions (e.g., "admin" claim) to authorize access to certain resources.

Token Revocation: Depending on your use case, you might want to implement token revocation mechanisms. This can involve maintaining a blacklist of revoked tokens or using token introspection endpoints provided by the authorization server.
